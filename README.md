This is the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

I will make a recipe website which will have links to a few recipes.

## Skills demonstrated

- Start a website from scratch
- Set a file structure for my website
- Structure content with HTML

- Practice atomic commits
- Write well structured commit messages (subject and body, character limit)
